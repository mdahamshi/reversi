# Welcome to my project
<h1>AI homework Reversi 12x12</h1>
<br/>
The game is written in C++ <br/>
The board is represnted by a BitSet Data structre (http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/bitset/bitset/)
<br/>
We used <b>Qt creator</b> to build the GUI, with <b>Qt Quick 2 (qml)</b>
<br/>
We used a <b>static</b> heuristic board for the <b>AI</b> part.
<br/>
Most of the game logic and the AI functions are in the <a href=https://github.com/mdahamshi/reversi/blob/master/game.h>game.h</a> file.
<br/>
The board is <b>12x12</b> in size, <b>BUT</b> you can edit the size easily by changing a couple of #define lines.
<br/>
You can contact me if you got stucked or need any help.
<br/>
Thank you and good luck.
